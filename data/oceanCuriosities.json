Along the coast, he sought out anyway through, failing several times until he ended up finding the strait along the tip of the continent, where Tierra del Fuego separates from the mainland. There, he discovered what’s now known as the Magellan Strait. It was on this journey, which was undertaken in order to circumnavigate the globe, the Magellan, also named the Pacific Ocean. When he entered into the new ocean waters, he found them to be unusually calm, inspiring him to name the ocean “Pacific,” from the Latin pacificus, meaning “tranquil.” ",

In Antarctica, as Scientific American put it, “the surface of the ice sheet at the South Pole is more than 9000 feet in elevation—more than a mile and a half above sea level.” (Higher elevations, of course, result in colder temps.) The average summer temperature at the North Pole is 32°F. At the South Pole, it’s -18°F.",

As for the real St. Nicholas? He was born in what is now Turkey.",
